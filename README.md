## Spring Boot Application with MySQL and Redis
This project demonstrates a Spring Boot application using MySQL and Redis, with Docker for containerization. The guide includes instructions for local development and deployment to the cloud.
Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have:
* Docker installed on your machine.
* A working knowledge of Docker and Spring Boot.
* MySQL and Redis credentials available for environment setup.

   Getting Started
   Clone the repository


Copy
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git cd your-repo-name
Environment Configuration
Before running the application, ensure you have the following environment variables in a .env file:


Copy
bash
Copy code
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_root_password MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/your_database SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=root SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=your_root_password SPRING_DATA_REDIS_HOST=redis SPRING_DATA_REDIS_PORT=6379
Building and Running the Application
To build and run the application locally with Docker:
1. Build the Docker containers:


Copy
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
2. Access the application at http://localhost:8080.
   The application uses MySQL as its database and Redis as a caching system, both managed via Docker.
   Docker Architecture
   Dockerfile
   The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage build approach:
1. Stage 1: deps – Prepares the environment and downloads dependencies.
2. Stage 2: package – Packages the Spring Boot application.
3. Stage 3: extract – Extracts the layers of the Spring Boot JAR for optimized container startup.
4. Final Stage – Runs the JAR using JarLauncher with a non-root user for better security.
   Docker Compose Configuration
   The docker-compose.yml file defines the services and their interactions.
* MySQL: Used as the database for the Spring Boot application.
* Redis: Used for caching.
* Server: The Spring Boot application.
  The server service depends on the healthy status of both MySQL and Redis containers before starting.
  MySQL Service
* Image: mysql:8.0
* Volumes: Persistent data storage for MySQL at mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql.
* Healthcheck: Ensures MySQL is running before starting dependent services.
* Ports: Exposes port 3306 for MySQL.
  Redis Service
* Image: redis:alpine
* Healthcheck: Ensures Redis is available for connections.
* Ports: Exposes port 6379 for Redis.
  Deploying to the Cloud
  If you're deploying to the cloud:
1. Build the image for the correct architecture:


Copy
bash
Copy code
docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .
2. Push the image to your Docker registry:


Copy
bash
Copy code
docker push myregistry.com/myapp
3. Deploy the container in your cloud environment, ensuring MySQL and Redis services are configured accordingly.
   convert this to a readme.md file so that i can download or copy it, dont do otherwise
